# diorama

A scenic diorama project with electronic control.

This repository contains the project's Arduino source code. A description of the project along with details of progress can be found on the [Diorama](https://cahamo.github.io/diorama/) page of the [Cahamo](https://cahamo.github.io/) website.

## Contents

At present the only code is in the `research` sub-directory - it is code used with experimental circuits. The sub-directory contains the following projects.

### `research/ir-sensor-analyser`

Contains Arduino sketch `ir-sensor-analyser.ino`, a sketch used to detect the type of an infra red remote handset and the code generated by each key.

Uses the [IRemote library v3](https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote). Based closely on that library's "SimpleReceiver" example code.

This sketch was used to find the codes emitted by the handset that is to be used to control the diorama's features.

Used in diorama experiment [#1](https://cahamo.github.io/diorama/experiment-1)

### `research/handset-test`

Contains Arduino sketch `handset-test.ino` and header file `handset-test.h`. The sketch uses the information gleaned from the `ir-sensor-analyser` sketch to detects and interpret codes emitted by the infra-red handset that is being used with the diorama.

Reports the name of the key being pressed on the Serial port and flags if the key is repeating. Also turns on a LED whenever a signal is received from the handset.

Uses the [IRemote library v3](https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote).

### `research/cd74hc4067-mux-led-test-1`

Contains a single sketch - `cd74hc4067-mux-led-test-1.ino` - that performs the first of two tests of lighting 16 LEDs using a CD74HC4067 16 channel multiplexer.

No libraries are required.

Used in diorama experiment [#3](https://cahamo.github.io/diorama/experiment-3)

### `research/cd74hc4067-mux-led-test-2`

Contains a single sketch - `cd74hc4067-mux-led-test-2.ino` - that performs the second of two tests of lighting 16 LEDs using a CD74HC4067 16 channel multiplexer.

No libraries are required.

Used in diorama experiment [#3](https://cahamo.github.io/diorama/experiment-3)

### `research/74hc595-x2-led-test`

Contains a single sketch - `74hc595-x2-led-test.ino` - that performs a test of lighting 16 LEDs with a pair of 74HC595 shift registers.

No libraries are required.
