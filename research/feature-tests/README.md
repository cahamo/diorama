This directory is the home for programs used to test the implementation of the diorama's electro-mechanical features.

## `basic-servo-test`

This program is designed for use on an Arduino Uno R3 clone, or Arduino Nano clone. It uses the `Servo` library to exercise a single servo motor.

It was developed (a) to learn how to use the `Servo` library and (b) to test that servo motors work.

Developed using PlatformIO.
