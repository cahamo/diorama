# LED Multiplixing Tests

A series of program used to investigate the best way to multiplex the diorama's model lighting.

The projects are:

## `cd74hc4067-mux-led-test-1`

Contains a single sketch - `cd74hc4067-mux-led-test-1.ino` - that performs the first of two tests of lighting 16 LEDs using a CD74HC4067 16 channel multiplexer.

No libraries are required.

Used in diorama experiment [#3](https://cahamo.github.io/diorama/experiment-3)

## `cd74hc4067-mux-led-test-2`

Contains a single sketch - `cd74hc4067-mux-led-test-2.ino` - that performs the second of two tests of lighting 16 LEDs using a CD74HC4067 16 channel multiplexer.

No libraries are required.

## `74hc595-x2-led-test`

Contains a single sketch - `74hc595-x2-led-test.ino` - that performs a test of lighting 16 LEDs with a pair of 74HC595 shift registers.

No libraries are required.
