# LED Multiplixing Tests

This is a set of programs used to investigate the best way to multiplex the diorama's model lighting.

All projects were developed under PlatformIO. The projects are listed below.

## `cd74hc4067-mux-led-test-1`

Contains a single C++ file - `cd74hc4067-mux-led-test-1.cpp` - that performs the first of two tests of lighting 16 LEDs using a CD74HC4067 16 channel multiplexer.

No libraries are required.

_Used in diorama experiment [#3](https://cahamo.github.io/projects/diorama/experiment-3)_

## `cd74hc4067-mux-led-test-2`

Contains a single C++ file - `cd74hc4067-mux-led-test-2.cpp` - that performs the second of two tests of lighting 16 LEDs using a CD74HC4067 16 channel multiplexer.

No libraries are required.

## `74hc595-x2-led-test`

Contains a single C++ file - `74hc595-x2-led-test.cpp` - that performs a test of lighting 16 LEDs with a pair of 74HC595 shift registers.

No libraries are required.
