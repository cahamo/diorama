# IR Control Tests

This is a set of projects used to investigate the operation of the infra-red controller and receiver that is to be used to control the diorama's electronic features.

All projects were developed under PlatformIO. The projects are listed below.

## `ir-sensor-analyser`

Contains C++ code `ir-sensor-analyser.cpp`, a sketch used to detect the type of an infra red remote handset and the code generated by each key.

Uses the [IRemote library v3](https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote). Based closely on that library's "SimpleReceiver" example code.

This sketch was used to find the codes emitted by the handset that is to be used to control the diorama's features.

## `handset-test`

Contains C++ code file `handset-test.cpp` and header file `handset-test.h`. The sketch uses the information gleaned from the `ir-sensor-analyser` sketch to detects and interpret codes emitted by the infra-red handset that is being used with the diorama.

Reports the name of the key being pressed on the Serial port and flags if the key is repeating. Also turns on a LED whenever a signal is received from the handset.

Uses the [IRemote library v3](https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote).
